**Unit 3: Torts** <span id="3"></span> 
**Tort is a branch of law that involves the enforcement of civil wrongs
in the absence of contracts. For example, if you are hit by another
vehicle and want to sue for medical costs, there is no contract between
you and the driver. This lawsuit it carried out within the tort system.
(When the terms of an existing contract are violated, enforcement must
be carried out outside the tort system.) Tort law allows individuals and
businesses that have been wronged to receive compensation for that
wrongdoing. Tort law is frequently used in situations involving medical
negligence. If your doctor accidentally removed the wrong arm and you
wish to sue, you would sue based on tort law. There are a number of
different types of torts, but the most common is negligence, which
involves a breach of the “duty of care.” In other words, in order to sue
on negligence, you must be able to prove that somebody that was
responsible for something violated that responsibility.**

    will see from this introduction that torts are another way in which
    American society enforces certain basic societal norms.

**3.3 Negligence** <span id="3.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    7: Section 2: Negligence”**

    Section 2:
    Negligence](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf)[”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 2. Have you ever been around someone who
    is being careless and ends up breaking something? If you become
    angry with them, they might answer, “I didn't do it on purpose.” But
    the tort of negligence tells us that even when a person does not
    commit wrongs on purpose, he or she still may be held accountable if
    that person did not exercise proper care. Note that the standard
    used in judging this is to ask what any reasonable person would do
    in the same situation. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the
    elements of negligence. Remember, if all of the elements of
    negligence are met, then it becomes necessary to determine what the
    damages were. Also, note that there are defenses to a charge of
    negligence. Remember to do the exercises at the end of the
    selection.

     Instructions: Read Section 1. Intentional torts involve the kind of
    wrongful action is most recognizably wrong. These are torts in which
    a person or persons has done an act purposefully. Note the wide

     Instructions: Read Section 3. The law recognizes that some torts
    require holding persons liable for their acts, even when they have
    exercised reasonable care. How could this be? Note the various
    situations in which persons are held to strict liability. Do you
    agree that these situations require a stricter level of
    accountability? For businesses that engage in the manufacture or
    sale of goods, product liability has emerged as an important area of
    business law. Pay particular attention to this discussion. Finally,
    complete the exercises at the end of the selection.
