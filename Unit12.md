     Instructions: If choosing to use this app, you will first need to
    download it to your Android device. Since this app is only available
    for Android users and has associated costs, its use in this course
    is optional. No quiz or exam questions will be derived from material
    within, but it is still a useful supplementary resource. Once
    downloaded, open the app and work through the flashcards and
    multiple-choice quiz questions. These two sections will help prepare
    you for the final exam. You may also find the “Make Custom
    Flashcards & Quiz” section useful as some of the material learned in
    this course may not have been covered in this app.
