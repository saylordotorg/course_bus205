**Unit 7: Employment Law** <span id="7"></span> 
*This unit will introduce you to employment law, also known as labor
law, regulations that are typically designed to protect the employee
from the employer. For example, though a number of Constitutional
amendments give equal rights to all races, religions, and genders,
issues pertaining to diversity still plague the workforce. Employment
law looks at these issues. *

**7.1 Employment at Will** <span id="7.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: *Business Law and the Legal Environment*: “Chapter 50:
    Section 2: Employment at Will”**
    Link: *Business Law and the Legal Environment*: [“Chapter 50:
    Section 2: Employment at
    Will](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Business%20Law%20and%20the%20Legal%20Environment.pdf)[”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Business%20Law%20and%20the%20Legal%20Environment.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 2, which deals with the predominant
    approach to employment in the United States – the employment at will
    doctrine. While this legal doctrine holds that an employee can be
    discharged for a good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all, you
    will soon see that there are limits to the reasons for which an
    employer can terminate an employee.

**7.2 Wage Law** <span id="7.2"></span> 
**7.2.1 Minimum Wage Laws** <span id="7.2.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: United States Department of Labor: Wage and Hour
    Division’s “Questions and Answers about the Minimum Wage”**
    Link: United States Department of Labor: Wage and Hour Division’s
    [“Questions and Answers about the Minimum
    Wage](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/BUS2057.2.1.pdf)[”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/BUS2057.2.1.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the Department of Labor's information on the
    minimum wage. In the United States, the federal government has set
    minimum wages which most all employers are required to pay to their
    employees. In addition, some states have minimum wage laws which
    require employers within the state to pay even higher minimum wages.
    This webpage from the United States Department of Labor, which
    enforces the federal minimum wage laws, provides answers to common
    questions about the laws.

**7.2.2 Prevailing Wage Laws** <span id="7.2.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: The Saylor Foundation’s “Prevailing Wage Laws”**
    Link: The Saylor Foundation’s [“Prevailing Wage
    Laws](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/BUS2057.2.2.pdf)[”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/BUS2057.2.2.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read The Saylor Foundation's article. Prevailing wage
    laws require that certain government contracts can only be entered
    into if employees will paid a predetermined “prevailing wage” in the
    local area affected by the contract. Ask yourself what are the
    potential benefits and drawbacks to such a requirement.

**7.3 Discrimination** <span id="7.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    12: Employment Discrimination”**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: [“Chapter 12:
    Employment
    Discrimination](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf)[”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the introductory materials for Chapter 12. The
    employment-at-will doctrine, which is prevalent in the United
    States, makes it relatively easy for an employer to fire an employee
    for most any reason. However, specific federal and state laws
    protect employees from being fired for reasons that government and
    society have determined to be wrongful discrimination. In the past
    sixty years or so, laws have been passed in the United States that
    protect against discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religious
    practice, and disability, to name some of the most prominent
    examples. Be aware that some forms of discrimination are not
    currently outlawed. Look at the Abercrombie & Fitch example to
    review the significant legal issues that accompany a claim of
    discrimination.

    workers. While union membership and impact has declined over the
    past few decades, federal and state law still play a strong role in
    regulating the relationships between labor and management.
