Course Syllabus for "BUS205: Business Law and Ethics"
-----------------------------------------------------

Law, in its simplest form, is used to protect one party from another.
For instance, laws protect customers from being exploited by companies.
Laws protect companies from other companies.  Laws even protect citizens
and corporations from the government. However, law is neither perfect
nor all encompassing. Sometimes, societal ethics fill the voids that
laws leave behind; other times, usually when societal ethics have been
systematically violated by a group of the population, we write laws that
are designed to require individuals to live up to certain ethical
standards. In the backlash of the Enron scandal (where Enron executives
used accounting tricks to hide losses) for example, new accounting laws
were passed. Similarly, as a result of the financial crisis of 2008,
legislators proposed new regulations designed to enforce a certain
standard of ethical behavior within the financial services industry.
This course will introduce you to the laws and ethical standards that
managers must abide by in the course of conducting business.  Laws and
ethics almost always shape a company’s decision-making process: a bank
cannot charge any interest rate it wants to charge – that rate must be
appropriate.  Car manufacturers must install hardware and develop new
technologies to keep up with regulations designed to reduce pollution.
By the end of this course, you will have a clear understanding of the
legal and ethical environment in which businesses operate. **This course
provides students the opportunity to earn actual college credit. It has
been reviewed and recommended for 3 credit hours by [The National
