**Unit 6: Intellectual Property** <span id="6"></span> 
**How many people have the recipe for Coca-Cola? Probably only a few
high-level executives within the company. The recipe gives Coca-Cola a
distinctive taste that is known the world over. If the recipe became
public knowledge, Coca-Cola might lose its advantage; therefore, this
recipe is one of the most closely guarded trade secrets in the US. *  
  
 *Trade secrets are one type of intellectual property (property that is
not tangible, but has an owner). Most forms of intellectual property are
protected by the government. When a famous author publishes a book, you
can’t go and copy the text and publish it under your name. The author
and publisher have a copyright on the text of the book. If you did try
to copy the book, you would be sued quickly. In this unit, we will look
at the ways in which intellectual property is leveraged in business and
study firms that rely solely on licensing their intellectual property
for income.**

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 15.5 hours.

Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

    what can and cannot be trademarked;
-   identify the requirements to hold a valid patent, and apply this
    knowledge to determine what can or cannot be patented;
-   define copyright, and determine when a copyright has been or has not
    been violated;
-   identify and describe the body of law that protect trade secrets,
    and apply this knowledge to determine situations in which trade
    secrets will or will not be protected; and

    9: Intellectual Property”**

    Property](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf)[”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the introductory materials for Chapter 9. As a
    review, ask yourself what kind of property interest discussed in
    Unit 5 an intellectual property right is. Is it tangible or
    intangible? Ask yourself what the importance of intellectual
    property rights is for contemporary business. Note that while
    patents or copyrights are the often the first examples to come to
    mind when discussing intellectual property, there are other
    important intellectual property rights. Lastly, pay attention to the
    discussion of reverse engineering of an Apple iPhone.

**6.1 Trademarks** <span id="6.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    9: Section 4: Trademarks”**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: [“Chapter 9:
    Section
    4: Trademarks](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf)[”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 4. Trademark laws allow companies to
    secure a claim to a specific identifying item, such as a name or
    design. Think of trademarked items you might be familiar with: those
    used by international restaurant chains, software companies, and
    mobile phone manufacturers. Trademarks set a company apart from
    similar companies and allow consumers of the companies’ products and
    services to readily identify the company. The government of the
    United States has adopted a specific regimen of laws to protect
    trademarks. As you read, note the many identifying categories that
    can be trademarked, including even the shape of a bottle. Be aware,
    too, of what cannot be trademarked under US law. Lastly, be aware of
    what remedies are available for infringement or dilution of a
    trademark and the defenses against these claims. Complete the
    exercises at the end of the section.

     Instructions: Read Section 2. Patent law is an increasingly complex
    area of the law filled with conflict and controversy. It creates a
    property right of the design of useful new inventions for a certain
    period, after which the patent expires. Be sure to take note of the
    three types of patents. Note also the kinds of things that cannot be
    patented. The section includes an interesting exploration of the
    ability to patent a living thing. Note the remedies available to
    patent holders when patents are infringed and the emergence of
    patent holding companies, or patent trolls, which derive revenue
    solely from suing for patent infringement. Lastly, complete the
    exercises at the end of the section.

     Instructions: Read Section 5. Copyright is another area of
    intellectual property law that has grown more controversial over the
    last twenty years, particularly with the rise of the World Wide Web.
    The Web has astronomically increased the availability of original
    written and creative material to the general public. For some, this
    easy access can cause confusion, creating the assumption that such
    material can be used by any person for any reason. Others have
    intentionally sought to bypass the protections available to such
    material. Some see the copyright protections available to creative
    work to be excessively restrictive; through various efforts, they
    attempt to promote the availability of creative works through open
    copyright licenses. In this section, familiarize yourself with the
    protections that US law provides to copyright holders. Note also how
    digital copyright licenses can further restrict the use of digital
    media. As always, pay attention to the remedies for copyright
    infringement and the defenses to such a claim. Finish with the
    exercises at the end of the section.

     Instructions: Read Section 3. Trade secret laws generally protect
    businesses that wish to maintain the confidentiality of such things
    as formulas, processes, or client lists because of the important
    economic value these things provide. Unlike trademark, patent, or
    copyright law, trade secret laws in the United States are dealt with
    in state, not federal, legislation. Be aware of both the civil and
    criminal penalties that go with stealing a trade secret, as well as
    potential defenses against such claims. Be sure to do the short
    exercise at the end of the section.
