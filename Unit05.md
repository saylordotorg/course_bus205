**Unit 5: Property Law** <span id="5"></span> 
**The idea of property usually strikes people as a fairly simple
concept. However, the law recognizes that the interests in various types
of property are often anything but simple and can sometimes result in
highly complex problems. For example, if you sell your house to someone,
what stays as part of the house and what can you take with you when you
leave? Certainly you would have an automatic right to take your clothes,
your furniture, and hanging photographs and artwork. But what about a
favorite chandelier? How about a built-in island in the kitchen? Can you
take the windows? The law recognizes two categories of property. There
is real property, which is land and anything attached to it, such as a
house and items attached to it. Alternatively, there is personal
property, which is everything else. As you work through this unit, ask
yourself when is it one item can be personal property in one situation
and real property in another.**

**5.1 Personal Property** <span id="5.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    8: Section 1: Personal Property”**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: [“Chapter 8:
    Section 1: Personal
    Property](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf)[”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 1. Books, cars, shares of stock, and
    accounts receivable are all personal property. Ask yourself how
    these things are the same. How are they different? Note also that
    some items that are personal property can be considered real
    property under certain circumstances. What are these circumstances?
    We all know that property can be transferred. Make sure you
    understand the various ways that ownership of personal property can
    be transferred. The text box entitled “Hyperlink: Finders
    Keepers?” and the associated links will help you understand these
    concepts. It is also important to know what legal rights and
    obligations are at stake when possession rather than ownership in
    personal property is transferred. The exercises at the end of the
    section should help confirm your understanding of this section.

**5.2 Real Property** <span id="5.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    8: Section 2: Real Property”**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: [“Chapter 8:
    Section 2: Real
    Property](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf)[”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 2. You have just learned about personal
    property. Recall from subunit 5.1 what distinguishes real property
    from personal property. Real property includes land and everything
    “attached” to the land. This concept is critical to whether we apply
    concepts related to personal property or to real property. Note also
    the unique requirements involved in the transfer of ownership of
    real property and the various ways in which such a transfer can be
    evidenced. Become familiar with the concept of “adverse possession.”
    Does adverse possession seem fair to you? When might it be fair, and
    when might it be unfair? Familiarize yourself with the various
    interests and duties that may go with the ownership of real
    property. Also, be aware of the scope of interests in real property.
    Lastly, as with personal property, possession of real property may
    be transferred without transferring ownership. Make sure you are
    informed about the various possessory interests in real estate.
    Finish the section by doing the concluding exercises.
