**Unit 2: Litigation vs. Alternative Dispute Resolution** <span
id="2"></span> 
**In general, legal problems between private parties can be addressed in
two basic ways **– **through the courts or through less formal
alternatives. In this unit, we will look at both the court process of
litigation and alternative methods of handling conflicts, known as
Alternative Dispute Resolution, or ADR. Going to court is usually an
expensive and time-consuming prospect. Businesses, which are always
looking for ways to more effectively manage costs and other resources,
can conserve both by first considering other ways to resolve disputes.
For example, before going to court over the failure of a business to
properly install equipment, a business might first consider entering
into informal negotiations with the installer to reach a conclusion that
is satisfactory to both sides. If this fails, the business might propose
the use of a mediator to reach a mutually beneficial result. Often,
contracts contain a provision requiring issues be submitted to
arbitration with a non-governmental official or organization that acts,
in essence, as judge and jury in the matter. If these efforts fail or it
is apparent that ADR would be unworkable from the beginning, then
businesses need to consider whether a dispute is best resolved in court,
with all of its formal requirements and protections. This unit will
begin by looking at the process by which businesses litigate disputes
and ask who is involved in litigation and what procedural requirements
must be met in order to successfully litigate a dispute. You will then
study the various methods of ADR available to businesses and consider
how these can be effectively used to deal with disputes.**

     Instructions: Read Section 2. In subunit 1.3.2, you explored the
    jurisdiction of various courts within the American system. But
    before a party to a lawsuit can even get into court, it must meet
    certain requirements. As you read, ask yourself who has the
    authority to bring a claim in court. How does a court determine
    this? In addition, consider that in the United States there are 51
    court systems. How does a court decide how much contact with the
    jurisdiction is required to bring a claim? These important
    considerations must be addressed before litigation begins.

     Instructions: Read the introductory material to Chapter 4. Note
    that ADR involves a range of methods that do not involve formal
    litigation. Study Figure 4.1 to attain an initial understanding of
    the formality and consensual nature of each method.

**2.2.1 Negotiation** <span id="2.2.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    4: Section 1: Negotiation”**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: [“Chapter 4:
    Section 1:
    Negotiation](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf)[”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 1. You will have noticed from Figure 4.1
    in the introduction to Chapter 4 that negotiation is the most
    informal and full consensual of the main ADR methods. Note that
    while negotiation helps avoid the costs of litigation, it also has
    certain drawbacks. This will be apparent when you review the
    material and click in “Hyperlink: Rubbermaid's Unequal Bargaining
    Power.” Pay attention to the concepts of BATNA and WATNA and how
    they fit into the “bargaining zone.” Finally, remember to do the
    exercises at the end of the selection.

**2.2.2 Mediation** <span id="2.2.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    4: Section 2: Mediation”**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: [“Chapter 4:

    Mediation](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf)[”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 2. You should have seen from Figure 4.1
    that mediation is further along the continuum from negotiation to
    litigation in terms of being somewhat more adjudicative and formal.
    Note that with mediation, we introduce a neutral third party;
    litigation also has a neutral third party: the judge. However, a
    mediator's authority is much more limited. The parties still need to
    agree on a resolution. Keep in mind that the voluntary nature of
    mediation can be both a strength and a weakness. After reading this
    selection, remember to do the exercises at the end.

     Instructions: Read Section 3. Arbitration is the method of ADR that
    looks most like litigation. While initial submission to arbitration
    may be voluntary, parties are generally bound by the decision of the
    arbitrator or arbitrators. Note the preference that federal and
    state governments in the United States often have for arbitration,
    particularly as a way of resolving contract disputes. Again, as you
    read, try to identify the relative strengths and weaknesses of
    arbitration. Lastly, complete the exercises at the end of the
    selection.
