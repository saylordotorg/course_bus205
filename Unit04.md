**Unit 4: Contracts** <span id="4"></span> 
**Contracts come in all shapes and sizes. You enter into a contract with
a broker and seller when you purchase a house. Businesses enter into
contracts with other businesses to set prices and solidify
relationships. And if you want reliable work done on your house, you
will have a contract with your contractor (hence the name).*  
  
 *Contracts are legally-binding relationships. In most circumstances, a
contract involves an agreement to deliver a product or service at a
specified time on a specified date. Violating a contract can result in a
lawsuit or some kind of settlement. While courts can be involved in this
process, these situations can also be settled outside of the judicial
system. Laws regarding contracts vary from state to state, so it is
always important to know the contract law in your area. This unit will
discuss contracts in great detail, but it will not cover everything. By
the end of this unit, you should have a general familiarity with how
most contracts are written and enforced.**

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 14.25 hours.

-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    6: Contracts”**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: [“Chapter 6:
    Contracts](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf)[”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the introductory material for Chapter 6. Note
    that the text defines a contract as “a legally enforceable promise.”
    In this unit, you will discover what it takes to make a promise
    legally enforceable. You will also find out what happens when such a
    promise is broken and what remedies are available to the damaged
    party.

**4.1 Nature and Classification of Contracts** <span id="4.1"></span> 
**4.1.1 Bilateral Contracts** <span id="4.1.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    6: Section 1: Formation”**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: [“Chapter 6:
    Section 1:

     Instructions: Read Section 1. Note that this reading will cover
    subunits 4.1.1 through 4.1.3 and all sections below subunit 4.2.
    Note the definition of a bilateral contract and make sure you can
    distinguish it from a unilateral contract.

**4.1.2 Unilateral Contracts** <span id="4.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by Section 1 of Chapter 6, which you
previously read in subunit 4.1.1. Note the definition of a unilateral
contract and make sure you can distinguish it from a bilateral contract.
Note how an action, rather than words, constitute the acceptance of an
offer in a unilateral contract.*  

**4.1.3 Contractual Terms** <span id="4.1.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by Section 1 of Chapter 6, which you
previously read in subunit 4.1.1. In the United States, statutes known
as the Uniform Commercial Code, or UCC, help prevent the unfair and
inefficient results that can occur when terms are either too strictly
interpreted or there is a deviation in the understanding of contract
terms. Because the common law has strict rules related to contract
formation, particularly when defining the terms of a contract, lawyers
and lawmakers agreed to new laws which would prevent contract law from
bogging down modern commerce.*

**4.1.4 Negotiable Instruments** <span id="4.1.4"></span> 
-   **Reading: Cornell University: Legal Information Institute’s
    “Negotiable Instruments”**
    Link: Cornell University: Legal Information Institute’s [“Negotiable
    Instruments](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/BUS205-NEGOTIABLE-INSTRUMENTS-LAW.pdf)[”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/BUS205-NEGOTIABLE-INSTRUMENTS-LAW.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read this brief overview of negotiable instruments.
    Be sure to click on the link to [Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial
    Code (UCC)](http://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/overview.html) for an
    explanation of the law in the United States governing negotiable
    instruments.

    ed*.: David P. Bianco’s “Negotiable Instruments”**
    Link: Reference for Business: *Encyclopedia of Business, 2nd ed*.:

    Instruments](http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/encyclopedia/Mor-Off/Negotiable-Instruments.html)[”](http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/encyclopedia/Mor-Off/Negotiable-Instruments.html) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this concise overview of the law of negotiable
    instruments. Again, note that in the United States negotiable
    instruments are governed by the UCC, Article 3. Ask yourself why
    strong laws related to negotiable instruments are so important in
    the modern business world. In addition, consider the important ways
    in which negotiable instruments as defined by Article 3 of the UCC
    differ from traditional contracts.

**4.2 Contract Formation** <span id="4.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by Section 1 of Chapter 6, which you
previously read in subunit 4.1.1. Pay close attention to all of the
“elements*”* that are required in order to make a promise legally
enforceable.*

**4.2.1 Offer and Acceptance** <span id="4.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by Section 1 of Chapter 6, which you
previously read in subunit 4.1.1. Note the importance of timing in
determining when and whether and offer has been accepted. When an offer
is made, a promise is made. However, an offer cannot be enforced until
it is accepted. Oftentimes, there is a delay between the offer by one
party and the acceptance by another. Ask yourself what happens if during
that delay the person making the offer changes his or her mind? Also,
note that what appears to be an offer may only be an *“*invitation to
bargain*”* rather than an offer that can be accepted.*

    Quiz”](http://school.saylor.org/mod/quiz/view.php?id=1231) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Complete this quiz. You must be logged into your
    Saylor Foundation School account in order to access this quiz. If
    you do not yet have an account, you will be able to create one, free

    to reinforce key terms and concepts that you will practice in the
    course project components. The correct answers will appear when you
    click “Submit.”

**4.2.2 Consideration** <span id="4.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by Section 1 of Chapter 6, which you
previously read in subunit 4.1.1. Make sure you understand that
consideration is not the same as money or payment. By saying that a
contract requires consideration, the law is simply requiring that a
party give up something to which it is otherwise entitled.*

**4.2.3 Intention** <span id="4.2.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by Section 1 of Chapter 6, which you
previously read in subunit 4.1.1. Simply put, in general the law of
contracts requires that there be a meeting of the minds between parties
to a contract. This relates closely to the discussion of offer and
acceptance in 4.2.1. Keep in mind that for a contract to be valid, the
mutual assent discussed in relation to offer and acceptance means that
the parties must appear to be agreeing to the same thing.*

**4.2.4 Legal Capacity** <span id="4.2.4"></span> 
-   **Reading: *Business Law and the Legal Environment*: “Chapter 10:
    Section 4: Capacity”**
    Link: *Business Law and the Legal Environment*: [“Chapter 10:
    Section 4:
    Capacity](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Business%20Law%20and%20the%20Legal%20Environment.pdf)[”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Business%20Law%20and%20the%20Legal%20Environment.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 4 of Chapter 10 from *Business Law and
    the Legal Environment*. This will supplement the reading in the
    *Legal and Ethical Environment of Business* text that addresses the
    issue of legal capacity to contract.

     Instructions: Read The Saylor Foundation’s article on the
    formalities of a contract. Note that while the most basic contracts
    require few or no formalities, in certain situations formalities
    must be followed.

**4.3 End of Contract and Enforcement** <span id="4.3"></span> 
**4.3.1 Breach of Contract** <span id="4.3.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: “Chapter
    6: Section 2: Performance and Discharge, Breach, Defenses, Equitable
    Remedies”**
    Link: *The Legal and Ethical Environment of Business*: [“Chapter 6:
    Section 2: Performance and Discharge, Breach, Defenses, Equitable
    Remedies](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf)[”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 2. Note that this reading will cover the
    material you need to know for subunits 4.3.1 and 4.3.4 through
    4.3.5. Once a contract is formed and the parties are bound by the
    contract, they generally have a legal obligation to perform
    according to the terms of the contract. Be sure you understand when
    the performance required is only substantial versus strict
    performance. Also, note the distinction between the prevalent
    “reasonable person” standard and the less common contractual
    standard of personal satisfaction. While one party's breach of a
    contract may result in damages, the party may have defenses against
    the claim. You should be aware of these defenses. Lastly, it is
    important to be aware of the remedies available for a party that is
    the victim of a breach.

     Instructions: Read The Saylor Foundation's article on unenforceable
    contracts. Unlike void or voidable contracts, unenforceable
    contracts are valid on their face but will not be enforced by a
    court.

**4.3.3 Third-Party Rights** <span id="4.3.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the YouTube lecture you viewed in
subunit 4.3.1. While one party's breach of a contract may result in
damages, it may have defenses against the claim. You should be aware of
these defenses. Lastly, it is important to be aware of the remedies
available for a party that is the victim of a breach of contract.*

**4.3.4 Remedies and Damages** <span id="4.3.4"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by Section 2 of Chapter 6, which you
previously read in subunit 4.3.1. While one party's breach of a contract
may result in damages, it may have defenses against the claim. You
should be aware of these defenses. Lastly, it is important to be aware
of the remedies available for a party that is the victim of a breach of
contract.*

**4.3.5 Discharge of Contracts** <span id="4.3.5"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by Section 2 of Chapter 6, which you
previously read in subunit 4.3.1. While one party's breach of a contract
may result in damages, it may have defenses against the claim. You
should be aware of these defenses. Lastly, it is important to be aware
of the remedies available for a party that is the victim of a breach of
contract. As noted in subunit 4.3.1, once a contract is formed and the
parties are bound by the contract, the parties generally have a legal
obligation to perform according to the terms of the contract. This is
why it is so important to determine when and if performance has
occurred. For this subunit, focus on the material describing how
performance is determined. Be sure to do the exercises at the end of the
selection.*

**4.4 Assignment and Delegation** <span id="4.4"></span> 
Note: This topic is covered by Section 2 of Chapter 6, which you
previously read in subunit 4.3.1.* Valid contracts give the parties
rights and impose obligations. For example, a business may have the
right to receive payment for the delivery of products. Conversely, the
business has a duty to deliver the products. Under some circumstances,
the parties to a contract can assign its rights under the contract (such
as receipt of payment) to a third party. Alternatively, a party may be
able to delegate its duties under the contract (such as delivery of
products) to a third party. But what if one party to a contract wants
only the other party to perform under the contract, instead of a third
party? Ask yourself what a party can do if it objects to an assignment
or delegation. Also, be aware of the other common clauses found in
contracts. Lastly, make sure you do the exercises at the end of the
selection.*
