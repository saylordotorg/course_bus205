**Unit 9: Business Organizations** <span id="9"></span> 
*Corporations are legal entities that protect shareholders from certain
legal liabilities. For example, if you start a sole proprietorship and
take out a small business loan to get started, you are personally liable
for that loan. If you do not repay the loan, the bank can pursue your
personal assets. If you are a shareholder in a corporation that fails to
pay its loans, however, the bank cannot pursue your personal assets.*  
    
 *Being a corporation has its own caveats. For example, corporations are
subject to more regulations and fees. This unit will look into the
various types of business entities in the United States and weigh the
pros and cons of each. We will emphasize corporations because most of us
will end up working for them.*

    business form. As noted in this section, understand how the law

     Instructions: Read Section 1. Sole proprietorships are the most
    common form of business organization, with good reason. There are no
    formal requirements to start a sole proprietorship. What other
    advantages are there to starting a business as a sole
    proprietorship? Note also the disadvantages that go with a sole
    proprietorship. The link in the textbox “Hyperlink: Small Businesses
    Squeezed as Banks Limit Lending” will give you insight into the
    challenges of borrowing money as a sole proprietor. Be sure you
    understand the issue of liability in sole proprietorships, as this
    will provide a foundation for discussions of limited liability forms
    of organizations in the following subunits.

previously read in subunit 9.2. General partnerships are the most common
form of partnership. Be aware of the significant similarities between
general partnerships and sole proprietorships. Also, note the
significant differences between them, especially the formalities that
generally go into forming and ending partnerships. Therefore,
partnerships almost always require the involvement of business lawyers.*

**9.2.2 Limited Partnerships** <span id="9.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by Section 2 of Chapter 11, which you
previously read in subunit 9.2. Work to understand the key distinctions
between limited partners and general partners in a limited partnership.
Also, notice how the limited partnership takes a step in the direction
of other limited liability organizational forms, such as requiring
compliance with statutory requirements for forming a limited
partnership.*

    accounting firms. This reading covers material you need to know for

**9.3.1 Public vs. Private** <span id="9.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by Section 3 of Chapter 11, which you
previously read in subunit 9.3. Public corporations are listed on stock
exchanges, offer their shares to the public, and are subject to the
highest level of regulation. Private corporations are often owned by a
small group of investors with a pre-existing relationship. These private
corporations are also referred to as “closely held corporations.”*

id="9.3.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by Section 3 of Chapter 11, which you

*Note: This topic is covered by Sections 3 and 4 of Chapter 11, which
you previously read in subunits 9.2.3 and 9.3, respectively. Because
corporations get significant protections under the law, they must also
be formed in strict accordance with the state statutes governing
corporate formation in the United States. Because corporate law is a
function of state government, corporations have choices about where to
incorporate and what corporate formation requirements to which they wish
to conform. The state of Delaware, in particular, plays a very important
role in the formation of corporations.*

**9.3.4 Shareholder Rights** <span id="9.3.4"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by Section 3 of Chapter 11, which you
previously read in subunit 9.3. This section contains a brief discussion

     Instructions: Read the Securities and Exchange Commission's
    material on corporate bankruptcy. When a corporation is unable to
    pay its debts, it is said to be insolvent. In the United States,
    bankruptcy laws help to protect creditors while allowing the debtor
    to start over. Note that corporations in the United States may
    reorganize and reach agreements with creditors as to how debts will
    be paid, if at all. Additionally, a corporation may just stop
    operating and liquidate all of its assets to satisfy a portion of
    its debts. Be aware of the distinctions between the two major types
    of bankruptcy.

     Instructions: Read Section 4. Limited liability companies (LLCs)
    are a relatively new form of business organization in the United
    States, but they have already been widely adopted, particularly by
    small businesses. With the many formalities and structural
    requirements required of corporations, LLCs offer a simpler
    alternative that is more suited to small businesses. Note, in
    particular, the similarities and differences of LLCs versus sole
    proprietorships and corporations. Why does the text refer to LLCs as
    a “hybrid form of business organization”? Be sure to familiarize
    yourself with the requirements needed to form and organize an LLC.
    Lastly, do the exercises at the end of the section.
