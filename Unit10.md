**Unit 10: Business Regulation** <span id="10"></span> 
*Regulation is always a source of debate within the business community.
In the wake of Enron’s massive fraud, for example, legislators passed
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in an attempt to force corporations to be
more diligent in their reporting and auditing. As a result, many
corporations have gone private to avoid SOX regulations. Other
corporations must devote so much of their resources to SOX, they can
barely maintain profitability. Regulations are passed all the time; it
is important that managers are aware of all regulations in development
and all regulations proposed for removal that could affect their
business.*

    that this is done and note the roles that several agencies in the
    United States government play in regulating businesses and the
    environment in which they operate.
