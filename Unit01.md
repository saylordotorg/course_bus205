**Unit 1: Nature and Sources of Law** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit will ask a series of broad questions about the law. How does
a law come into being? (Legislators pass them, of course, but how do
regulating bodies and judicial precedent contribute to the process as
well?) In a broader sense, why do we have laws at all? Is it possible
for us to govern ourselves?   
  
 In this introductory unit, we will explore the historical events that
have shaped business law in the United States. We will also review U.S.
court systems, discussing the roles they play in shaping the business
law of the country and learning how they enforce those laws.*

    and in others it can be brought in a federal court. Some courts have

    jurisdiction. These issues will be clarified in this section.
