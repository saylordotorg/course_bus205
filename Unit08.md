**Unit 8: Criminal Law and Business** <span id="8"></span> 
*Like torts, criminal law deals with what happens when an individual or
group of individuals commits a wrong against another individual or group
of individuals. However, criminal laws are enforceable through
prosecution by the state. Criminal law pertains to the direct violation
of an existing law. In criminal law cases, there is a prosecution, a
defense, and, in many cases, a jury of peers. This unit will focus on
criminal law in the business community*.

    10: Criminal Law”**

    Criminal
    Law”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/The%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Environment%20of%20Business.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the introductory materials for Chapter 10. Prior
    units dealing with civil law and informal alternatives have covered
    the most typical interactions a business person will have with the
    law. Unfortunately, some businesses and business people do end up
    becoming involved in the criminal justice system. The last decade in
    the United States has produced some very prominent examples,
    including the investment manager Bernie Madoff and Tyco
    International CEO Dennis Kozlowski. White collar and other
    business-related crime can have a major impact on the public’s
    perception of a business and its executives and employees. For
    ethical as well as economic reasons, it is very important for
    business leaders to be aware of the potential for crime in the
    business world and to take steps to guard themselves and their
    businesses against it. The introduction to Chapter 10 will provide
    an overview of the issues businesspeople face relating to crime.

     Instructions: Read Section 1. Chapter 10 provides an overview of
    criminal law in general, including constitutional protections for

    nature of punishment in criminal law. Pay particular attention to
    the discussion of the burden of proof in criminal cases. Compare
    this burden of proof to the burden in civil cases, noting the
    apparent contradictions that can arise from these differences. At
    the end of the section, do only Exercise 2.
