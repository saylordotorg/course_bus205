**Unit 11: Business Ethics** <span id="11"></span> 
*Running a successful business is not simply a matter of obeying the
law. There are areas, some addressed by the law and others not, where we
have to ask ourselves whether it would be right or wrong to do a
particular thing. A life in business often presents us with different
ethical challenges. For example, while it may be legal for executives at
companies laying off employees to award themselves, at the same time,
substantially higher salaries and bonuses, is it right? In this unit, we
will present an overview of the many ethical challenges businesses and
business-people face. We will look at how ethics applies to various
areas within the modern business. This unit will also take a look at
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), which works from the premise that
just because it is legal to do something, doesn’t mean it should be
done. It may be legal for a corporation to dump a certain amount of
waste, but if that impacts the community in a negative way, it could
damage the reputation of the business. Corporate Social Responsibility
and established business ethics seek to identify a balance between doing
what’s right for the community and doing what’s best for a company’s
shareholders.*
